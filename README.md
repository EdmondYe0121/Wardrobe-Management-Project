# Wardrobe Management System

## Overview
The Wardrobe Management System will help its users to manage all the clothes and shoes that
his family has more efficiently. The system will allow its users to customize their wardrobes 
and store different kinds of clothes.

The **potential users** are people that wants to save time and have a more ordered lives.

In a normal canadian family, there is usually more than one wardrobe to store clothes and shoes.
Additionally, kids, adults and elderly people all have different kinds of clothes. Moreover, with
the change in time in a year, various kinds of clothes are required for specific time periods.
The clothes that are taken out from wardrobe might not be put back in the same way or put in the wrong
wardrobe. If the situation persists, problems like summer clothes mixed with winter clothes 
or kids' clothes put in adults' wardrobe would happen. Thus, this problem attracts me and 
I want to create a system that could help people manage their wardrobe more efficiently and save time.

- A cloth is added to the wardrobe
- A cloth is removed from the wardrobe

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would perform refactoring on the WardrobeUI class. There are number of methods that used to
create the panel with a button, and they all have duplicated code. I would extract a common method to reduce the 
duplication. In this way, the program will be easier to understand and more efficient.
